# Angular Weather App

This is a web application showing the weather forecast in Edinburgh for the following days.

The web application is hosted at: https://angular-weather-app-84243.firebaseapp.com/
 
The technology stack and development tools that were used are:

HTML

CSS

Typescript

JavaScript

Angular 5

Angular Material

Angular CLI

Bootstrap

NodeJs

Npm

Firebase

Visual Studio Code

## How to run the application

Install NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install Npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Using terminal, navigate to the application folder.

Run command: `npm install`

Run command: `./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve --open`

If everything is done correctly, the application will build and the browser will open a new tab with the url http://localhost:4200 were the application is successfully served.

## Future additions

If I had more time:

I would write unit tests, testing components' methods in different possible parameter cases.

I would create Protractor End2End tests using a page model pattern.

I would use ngrx (Andular equivelant of Redux)

I would make the Weather API calls go through my server and keep the api key into an encrypted config file.
